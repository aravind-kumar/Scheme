# scheme
Hey there my name is aravind.
Starting today i am going to learn the functional programming language scheme.

#Why Functional Programming?

After programming in C,C++ and Java.
Once i started to code in a pure functional language, 
I started to appreciate the concepts and abilities provided by a pure functional language such as Lamda functions,Higher order functions etc.
Although these concepts are just the tip of the ice berg, I am motivated and willing to learn since i experinced that once i understood the concepts my coding style and thinking started to change and transformed me into a better programmer.

#Why Scheme

Well i wanted to start out with haskell,
However i also wanted to find which is the best functional programming language to start out with.
And i landed upon 
[What is the best programming language to get started by Jean Yang]

Summary of text:
Haskell is beautiful and will teach you to think about programming in a new way.
But if you want to learn the basics of functional programming, Scheme is hands-down the best.
Functional programming boils down to one key idea: you do everything with functions. 
No other language distills out this concept the way Scheme does. 
After learning Scheme, you'll be well-equipped to recognize and use functional patterns in more complex languages.
